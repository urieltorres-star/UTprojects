        <h2>Gameplay Instructions</h2>
        <p>Pac-Man is an action maze chase video game; the player controls the eponymous character 
            through an enclosed maze. The objective of the game is to eat all of the dots 
            placed in the maze while avoiding four colored ghosts—Blinky (red), Pinky (pink), 
            Inky (cyan), and Clyde (orange)—who pursue Pac-Man. 
            When Pac-Man eats all of the dots, the player advances to the next level. 
            Levels are indicated by fruit icons at the bottom of the screen. 
            In between levels are short cutscenes featuring Pac-Man and Blinky in humorous, 
            comical situations.</p>
            <break>
            </break>
            <p>If Pac-Man is caught by a ghost, he loses a life; the game ends when all lives are lost.
                Each of the four ghosts has its own unique artificial intelligence (A.I.), 
                or "personality": Blinky gives direct chase to Pac-Man; Pinky and Inky try to
                position themselves in front of Pac-Man, usually by cornering him; and Clyde 
                switches between chasing and fleeing from Pac-Man depending on his distance 
                from him.
            </p>
            <break>
            </break>
            <p>Placed near the four corners of the maze are large flashing "energizers" or
                "power pellets". When Pac-Man eats one, the ghosts turn blue with a dizzied 
                 expression and reverse direction. Pac-Man can eat blue ghosts for bonus points;
                when a ghost is eaten, its eyes make their way back to the center box
                in the maze, where the ghost "regenerates" and resumes its normal activity.
                Eating multiple blue ghosts in succession increases their point value. 
                After a certain amount of time, blue-colored ghosts 
                flash white before turning back into their normal forms. 
                Eating a certain number of dots in a level causes a bonus item—usually 
                a fruit—to appear underneath the center box; the item can be eaten for 
                bonus points. To the sides of the maze are two "warp tunnels", which allow
                 Pac-Man and the ghosts to travel to the opposite side of the screen. 
                 Ghosts become slower when entering and exiting these tunnels.
            </p>

            <p>
                The game increases in difficulty as the player progresses: 
                the ghosts become faster, and the energizers' effect decreases in duration,
                eventually disappearing entirely. An integer overflow causes the 256th level 
                to load improperly, rendering it impossible to complete. 
                This is known as a kill screen.
